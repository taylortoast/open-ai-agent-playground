# Agent Mode Project Charter

This repository is dedicated to testing, evaluating, and demonstrating ChatGPT Agent Mode capabilities when connected to GitHub.  
The agent may create, modify, and delete files only when explicitly instructed to do so.

---

## 🧭 Purpose
- Validate that ChatGPT Agent Mode can successfully generate code, assets, and documentation.
- Test file creation, modification, deletion, branching, and commit workflows.
- Evaluate multi-step task handling and project expansion via the agent.

---

## 📂 Expected Project Structure
The repository may contain:
- Sample code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C#, etc.)
- Test applications or scripts
- Documentation and logs generated by the agent
- Configuration or data files used for experimentation

There is **no fixed framework**; files will be added as needed.

---

## 📘 Agent Instructions
The agent should:
1. Ask for confirmation before committing changes.
2. Provide a clear description of every file it intends to create or modify.
3. Use clean, readable folder structures.
4. Write descriptive commit messages.
5. Avoid overwriting existing files unless instructed.

---

## 🚦 Scope Limits
- No destructive changes without explicit user approval.
- No external integrations beyond GitHub unless specifically requested.
- No automated deployment actions (CI/CD) unless approved.

---

## 📅 Versioning Guidelines
- Prefer the following commit style for clarity:
  - `feat: add feature description`
  - `fix: correct issue description`
  - `docs: update documentation`
  - `test: add test cases`
  - `refactor: code reorganization`
  - `chore: maintenance`

---

## 👤 Ownership
The repository belongs to the user.  
The agent acts only when prompted and does not make autonomous changes outside instructions.

---

## 📝 Notes
This charter may be updated over time as testing evolves.
